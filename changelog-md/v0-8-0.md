### Added

- Add a new hook `useUserSignedIn` to check if the user is signed in.
- Add a new API file `/me` to reflect the `me` API.

### Changed

- Musicn comes back with a new look! Powered by Chakra UI. This allows Musicn to look more modern and clean! (and consistent too!). Although, this is still a work in progress. We will be adding more features and improving the design in the future. Profile page and some links redirection are still using the old design and not working. We will be updating them soon!

### Fixed

- None

### Removed

- Gridify is at its early stages. We have removed Gridify in hopes to add it back in the future with more features and a better design.
