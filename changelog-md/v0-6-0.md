### Added

-   **BETA** - Added Gridify! A new way to share your top songs in a grid format. You can find it by clicking on Gridify in the navigation bar!
    -   You can click on the "Save" button in the page to save as an image and share it on your Social Media accounts.
-   Added a new Music Preview. Click on any song on anybody's page to see a preview of the song!

### Unresolved issues

-   The output image of Gridify pushes the text to the bottom. This is a known issue and will be fixed soon.
-   When your top song is set to private, the output image will show nothing. This is a known issue and will be fixed soon.
    -   The workaround is to temporarily set your top song to public and then set it back to private.

### Changed

-   Overhauled the Music Preview dialog to a new design that pops out from the bottom! (Like a real music player)
-   Updated `link` page to include information about Musicn's features.
-   Updated the design of the Music Preview dialog's texts.

### Fixed

-   Fixed submitting form in the Sign up page would bring you to the Agreement page.

### Removed

-   None
