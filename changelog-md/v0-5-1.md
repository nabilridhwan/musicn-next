### Added

-   Added a Spotify data status section in the Profile page! This will show users if their permissions are out of date, and if they need to re-authenticate with Spotify.
    -   Try it out by clicking the "Spotify" tab in the Profile page!

### Changed

-   Changed the checkboxes for the preferences in profile page to be a switch (akin to the toggle-switch you see in iOS)
-   Overhauled the Profile page to use tab navigation.
-   Overhauled the changelog page (it's now like a blog!)

### Fixed

-   None

### Removed

-   **[TEMP]** Removed the footer from every page.
