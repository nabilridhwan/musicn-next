### Added

- Added loading spinners in buttons for Login, Signup and Edit profile buttons.

### Unresolved issues

- The navigation bar will show 'Login' and 'Signup' even when you're logged in. Clicking on either this buttons will redirect you to your profile page.
  - I'm still finding a good way to fix this while upholding security.

### Changed

- When linking Spotify account, you will be redirected to Spotify's login page even if you have already previously signed in.
  - This is so that users can change their Spotify account if needed.

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where users will be redirected to the users page when they try to go to the profile page.
  - Added BigInt serialization to the model file.
- Fixed an issue where users who unlink Spotify accounts will receive either a `Internal Server Error` or `Client Error`.

### Removed

- None
