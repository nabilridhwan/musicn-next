title: 'v0.3.0'
desc: 'Login, signup, profile and Spotify linking! (and Dev changes too!)'
---

### Added

- **[BETA]** Added basic login and signing up capabilities! _(Behavior of login and signup might change in the future!)_
  - Forget password functionality is still in development.
- Added profile page.
  - In this page, you can re-link or unlink your Spotify account and edit your profile. _(Behavior of linking and unlinking might change in the future!)_

### Unresolved issues

- The navigation bar will show 'Login' and 'Signup' even when you're logged in. Clicking on either this buttons will redirect you to your profile page.
  - I'm still finding a good way to fix this while upholding security.

### Changed

- **[DEV]** Added alias for basePath in `tsconfig.js`. The path `@/` refers to the root directory now.
  ```js
  import {BaseResponse} from '../../classes/baseResponse'; // => OLD - Endless going back
  import {BaseResponse} from '@/classes/baseResponse'; // => NEW - Neater!
  ```
