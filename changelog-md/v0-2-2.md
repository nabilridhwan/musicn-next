### Added

-   Add a new icon for Musicn! (New favicon)
-   Add title for every page in the Head tag

### Changed

-   None

### Fixed

-   Fixed `prisma is undefined` which causes users not to be able to access other users' profiles.
    -   This is fixed by adding a model function to update the profile picture and calling it in `/api/user/:username` instead of updating it directly from the route!

-   None
